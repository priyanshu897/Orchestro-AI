    """
    The LinkedIn Posting Agent generates a LinkedIn post and simulates publishing it.

    In a real-world scenario, this agent would:
    - Receive content (image and text) from previous agents.
    - Use a library or API to interact with the LinkedIn API.
    - Publish the post, including the image and a generated description.

    For this prototype, we'll simulate the process and confirm success.

    Args:
        state: The current state of the workflow, containing the image and script.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the new `posting_status` for LinkedIn to update the state.
