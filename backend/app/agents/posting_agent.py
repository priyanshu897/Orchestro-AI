    """
    The Cross-Platform Posting Agent generates platform-specific content and simulates posting.

    In a real-world scenario, this agent would:
    - Take the clip metadata from the previous agent.
    - Use the LLM to generate platform-specific captions and hashtags.
    - Interact with social media scheduling APIs (e.g., Hootsuite, Buffer) or
      direct platform APIs to schedule and post the content.

    For this prototype, we'll simulate these steps and return a success message.

    Args:
        state: The current state of the workflow, containing the topic and clip info.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the new `posting_status` to update the state.
